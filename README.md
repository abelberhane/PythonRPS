# PythonRPS

Classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game developed in the Python Coding Language. I am also working on utilizing comments to break up my code
and explain what each chunks are meant to do. This will allow other people to interpret my thought process as well as make it easier for
anyone to pick it up and be able to make changes. 

I am running into an issue at the moment where the final compare portion does not print the final result. I am working on this fix shortly. The code becomes unreachable once I enter sys.exit(). This is not allowing the print compare statement to be performed.
